Action Input: "python programming language history"
Observation: The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing cent
ral role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the ... In the 32 years since Python launched, the language has become a go-to for millions of developers, from beginners taking their first foray into coding to experienced engineers who use Python for machine learning and AI. In fact, Python is the most popular programming langu
age in our course catalog. Start learning Python today Learn Python 3 The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer pr
oductivity. In January 1994, version 1.0 was released, and a separate Usenet group for it was created, marking a milestone in the history of Python. Around that time, multiple other dynamically typed and interpreted languages similar to Python were created, such as Perl and Ruby, which shows that the need for such a language was definitely
in the air. The Zen of Python is 19 "guiding principles" structured for the Python language, that is meant to aid writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Tim Peters(Software engineer) posted this list of principles on the Python mailing list in 1999. He left the 20th principle for van Rossum t
o fill in.
Thought:

 Wow, I never knew that! So the language was created by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands in the late 1980s, and it was released in 1991. It's interesting to see how it has become so popular over the years and how it's designed to be readable and productive for developers.

Observation: Source code: Lib/__future__.py. __future__ is a real module, and serves three purposes: To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and expect to find the modules they're importing.

This module includes all the latest functions which were not present in the previous version in Python. And we can use this by importing the __future__ module. Its releases are in P
ython version 2.1. ``future`` is the missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead. It is designed to be used as follows:: from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_lit
erals) For developers, the future of Python looks bright. The demand for skilled Python developers will grow as the language grows in popularity and new features are added. In 2023, we can expect Python developers to work on various projects, from web applications to AI and machine learning. Easy, clean, reliable Python 2/3 compatibility ¶.
